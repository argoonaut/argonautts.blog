## üèóÔ∏è How to build

If you like to build it from scratch:

```
$ pip3 install poetry
$ poetry install
$ poetry run manage.py migrate
$ poetry run manage.py runserver 8000
```

Don't forget to create an empty Postgres database called `argonautts_blog` or your migrations will fail.

Another option for those who prefer Docker:

```
$ docker-compose up
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 and see an empty page.
